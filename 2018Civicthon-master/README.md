# Pomodoro-Planner

Pomodoro Planner is a web application that allows you to streamline your work efficiency. It is the combination of a todo list and the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "Pomodoro Technique Wikipedia") (25 minutes working, 5 minutes break -- on & off) that helps people do their work as fast as possible.

This app was pretty simple. The backend framework was [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js Official Website"), but we used [express.js](https://expressjs.com/ "Express.js Official Website") to serve up the index page (this app was one page, so there were no other pages that were served). This index.html file had its functionality added through other scripts that were simply added to the app through script linking. For the front end, we used Google's [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/ "Materialize Official Website")
